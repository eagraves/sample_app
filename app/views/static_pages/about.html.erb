<h2>About The Tutorial</h2>
  <p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial. Similar to Twitter, it
  allows users to sign up for a social sharing service when they can 
  make microposts (160 character or less text posts) and follow other 
  users and their microposts.

<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    This specific instance was implemented by aspiring software 
    developer Evan Graves, following the above tutorial from beginning 
    to end, with a few changes. It was an exercise in Rails web 
    development to further my knowledge in the requisite languages and 
    tools: Ruby/Embedded Ruby, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Rspec, 
    Capybara, and some SQL and JavaScript.
